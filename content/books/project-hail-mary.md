description: "**A lone astronaut must save the earth from disaster in this
  incredible new science-based thriller from the #1 _New York Times_ bestselling
  author of _The Martian_.**  \r

  \r

  \  Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission–and
  if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish.   \r

  \r

  \  Except that right now, he doesn’t know that. He can’t even remember his
  own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.   \r

  \r

  \  All he knows is that he’s been asleep for a very, very long time. And
  he’s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with
  nothing but two corpses for company.   \r

  \r

  \  His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, he realizes that an
  impossible task now confronts him. Alone on this tiny ship that’s been cobbled
  together by every government and space agency on the planet and hurled into
  the depths of space, it’s up to him to conquer an extinction-level threat to
  our species.   \r

  \r

  \  And thanks to an unexpected ally, he just might have a chance.   \r

  \r

  \  Part scientific mystery, part dazzling interstellar journey, _Project
  Hail Mary_ is a tale of discovery, speculation, and survival to rival _The
  Martian_–while taking us to places it never dreamed of going."
